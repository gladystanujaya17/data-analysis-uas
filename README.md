# Code Documentation Data Analysis Final Exam
## Background
Wine is an alcoholic drink which is the result of fermentation from crushed fruit or grapes. 
The alcohol content in wine is around 12-15%. 
Even though grapes are used, the type of grapes used is from the Vitis vinifera species, different from the grapes that are usually eaten every day. 
Wine is known to have high antioxidants so it can provide health benefits.
In this research, the data tested was the result of analysis of grapes grown in the Italian region, but came from three different cultivars. 
There are 178 data samples in the dataset with 13 parameters in the table and all data is of numeric type.

## Algorithm Used in Code Documentation
1. **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)**: 
K-Nearest Neighbor is a one of Machine Learning algorithm. This simple algorithm has an important role in carrying out deep classification. K-NN is also categorized as Supervised Learning. K-NN algorithm works based on with the proximity of data to other data and closeness of the distance is measured based on the Euclidean distance.

2. **Decision Tree**:
Decision Tree is an algorithm that uses a set of rules to make decisions with a tree-like structure. The concept of a Decision Tree is to present an algorithm with conditional statements, including branches that represent decision-making steps that can lead to a favorable outcome. The advantage of the Decision Tree algorithm is that it is easy to read and understand without requiring statistical knowledge. Apart from that, Decision Trees are also easy to prepare without having to calculate complicated calculations. The disadvantage of Decision Trees is that they are unstable and less effective in predicting outcomes from continuous variables.

## Research Methodology
### 1. Business Understanding
This stage is the stage to understand the objectives from an overall research perspective. Business Understanding in this research is to find out predictions from wine analysis using the K-NN and Decision Tree algorithms.

### 2. Data Understanding
This stage is the stage to understand the contents of the data as a whole. This process is the initial analysis stage in wine dataset research using several common functions such as info, shape, and describe.

### 3. Data Preparation
This stage is the stage for preparing data from raw data to cleaner data. In research, this stage is the preprocessing stage, such as looking for outliers, missing values, etc. Data must be clean before being analyzed by algorithms to produce accurate results.

### 4. Modelling
This stage is the stage for carrying out a prediction model using a classification algorithm. In this research, the algorithms used are the K-NN and Decision Tree algorithms.

### 5. Evaluation
This stage is the stage for evaluating the prediction model that was created in the previous stage. The results of this evaluation can be carried out using the Classification Report and Confusion Matrix.

### 6. Deployment
This stage is the stage to find out the information that can be obtained from the prediction process. The information that will be taken is the level of accuracy of the prediction model, the error rate of the prediction model, a comparison of the error rate with the prediction values ​​used, such as the K value for K-NN and max depth for Decision Tree, and a comparison of the error rate between K-NN and Decision Tree.
